This is a super-basic app to demonstrate some simple database things in Ruby.

db/schema.rb has the database schema, which is automatically created by running and modifying the files in...
  db/migrate/...

Each database table is referenced by a MODEL, which is described in app/models/...
In this super-simple example, the only thing each model does (beyond basic things that come with models like giving you their stored data from the database) is know that there is a relationship between Projects and Tasks: Projects can have many tasks, tasks have one project.
In a full-fledged app, additional business logic, validations, etc would live in the model file.
